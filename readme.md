###2013-02-20 version 0.10beta released###
I've changed a coupe of things in this release.
- I have changed the transport. LongPolling now uses [basic-http-client][bhc] instead of [Aquery][aq] for http communication. I've removed all dependencies on [Aquery][aq].
- Hubs is now implemented. Checkout my implementation and say what you think about it. Calling functions on server from client, and calling functions on client from server is supported. NOTE! State is not implemented yet.
- I've included a new sample, HubDemo, in the repo. It shows how you can implement hubs.
- I have also set up a [SignalR][sr] server on Appharbor so HubDemo can talk to it. You'll find it [here][calc].


###2013-02-20 version 0.9beta released###
Version 0.9beta uses the SignalR-protocol version 1.2 which is used in the 1.0 release of SignalR.
It has also (beta)support for groups.

##Description##
SignalA is a [SignalR][sr]-client for Android. It's implemented as a Android-library. At this moment is long polling the only implemented transport. Long polling is a separate library.
Http-requests in the Long polling library is using [basic-http-client][bhc].

##Add SignalA to your project##
SignalA is published on Maven Central as a ARR. If you're using Android Studio/Gradle all you have to do is add it on your gradle build:

	dependencies {
	    compile 'com.github.erizet.signala:signala-longpolling:0.20'
	}

##How to use?##
Add the following code to your activity.

      String url = "http://<address to your SignalR-server>";
      con = new com.zsoft.signala.Connection(url, this, new LongPollingTransport()) {

			@Override
			public void OnError(Exception exception) {
	            Toast.makeText(DemoActivity.this, "On error: " + exception.getMessage(), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
			}

			@Override
			public void OnMessage(String message) {
	            Toast.makeText(DemoActivity.this, "Message: " + message, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
			}

			@Override
			public void OnStateChanged(StateBase oldState, StateBase newState) {
			}
		};

To start and stop the SignalA connection use code similar to the following.

	public void startSignalA()
	{
		if(con!=null)
			con.Start();
	}
	
	public void stopSignalA()
	{
		if(con!=null)
			con.Stop();
	}

That's it!

For a complete sample see the Demo-project.

##Limitations##
Hubs don't support State yet.

##Contributions##
I'll be more than happy to get contributions!!!
